Part 1: Auditing and Test Cases

The goal of the first part of this assignment was to identify bugs across the Django web application. We were then
asked to conduct four attacks that exploit these bugs. To begin, I spent a large amount of time reading throught the code,
particularly, how data was being passed through various functions, how URL post/requests were handled, where authentication
was used, how the website interacted with the database, and so forth. I began to notice a pattern where I could pass arbitrary
code and data to specific functions or variables that did not have sanitation or validation within the source code.

The first step in my test cases was to set up some objects that I could use to manipulate the website. I understood that with each
test run, a 'test' database is created and deleted upon completion of test cases, so I had to initialize some users, a product, and
at one point, a giftcard. I also set up some global variables with URLs I know were susceptible to manipulation via python requests;
whether it was a GET or POSt request, I could make injections or output sensitive data.
